In this section, we will focus on exchanges of goods and services. Once again, the main issue in recognizing these transactions lies in their proper valuation.

Generally speaking, these transactions are assessed at the fair value either of the goods or services received or the goods or services suppliedâ€”**whichever is more accurate**.

Please note: If the disparity of values in the exchange or barter is too great, and to avoid managing credits, or other liabilities that might accrue over time, it may be preferable to conduct two separate transactions.

Exchanges can also be treated as separate contributions.

To account for these <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/en/toolkit/glossary#non-monetary-exchanges" target="_blank" title="Also referred to as 'bartered exchanges' or 'exchanges of goods and services', exchanges of assets, liabilities, or non-monetary services against other assets, liabilities, or non-monetary services, with no or negligible monetary consideration such as in partnerships and co-productions where each partner contributes in kind goods and services of more or less equal value, commonly known as barter.">non-monetary exchanges</a>, it is important to ensure that the assessment of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/en/toolkit/glossary#fair-value" target="_blank" title="A payment amount agreed upon by willing parties in the normal course of business, on a level playing field such as retail sales prices of local or online commerce.">fair value</a> is sufficiently reliable. If the fair value is not sufficiently reliable, do not record it.

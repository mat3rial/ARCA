A donor inherits a work of art valued at $1,500. Two years later, she donates the work to a registered charity. Before donating the artwork, the donor has it appraised at a value of $2,000.

{% include accordion_example.html
example_text="Since the donor is donating the artwork within three years of having inherited it, the amount indicated on the charitable donation receipt must correspond to the lesser market value and its cost to the donor immediately before the donation was made. In this case, the cost to the donor at the time she inherited the work is deemed to be the fair market value of $1,500. Therefore, the amount of the receipt should be $1,500."
%}

In addition to the information mentioned above, the charity must supply the following information on their receipt:

* A description of the received goods.
* The name and address of the appraiser, if applicable.

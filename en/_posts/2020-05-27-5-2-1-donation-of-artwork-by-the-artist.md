If an artist donates an artwork, the charitable organization can issue a receipt in the amount deemed as fair market value (FMV) for that artwork.  When the FMV is less than $1,000, the assessment can be made by a member of the charity or someone with sufficient knowledge of the goods in question (i.e. the curator or artistic director in an artist-run centre).

The value of the donation will be the fair market value of the artwork, less the artistâ€™s share of the sale at auction, as per the agreement between the artist and the organization.

[see the template _Artwork Contract Donation_ in the Toolkit]({{site.baseurl}}/en/toolkit/templates/){: .toolkit}

{% include accordion_example.html
example_text="An artist gives a charity an artwork valued at $1,000. The charity sells the work at auction for $400 and  gives the artist $200 in return, 50% of the sale price as per their agreement. The amount of the advantage ($200) must be subtracted from the amount of the gift (the $1,000 value of the artwork). So, the eligible amount of the gift is $800."

**Note**

If the amount of the advantage is more than 80% of the fair market value of the gift, an official donation receipt cannot be issued.

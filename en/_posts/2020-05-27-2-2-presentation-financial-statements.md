When an organization chooses to record contributions of goods and services, it must present the following information in its financial statements:
<ul class="textlist">
<li>1. The method used;</li>

<li>2. The kind and amount of contributed goods and services recorded in the financial statements.</li>
</ul>

The contribution received in the form of goods and services must be evaluated at fair value at the **time of the donation**.

**Notes disclosing contributions received in the form of donated goods and services other than volunteer labour:**

{% include accordion_example.html
title="Example 1 - contribution of goods and services"
example_text="Donated materials and services are recorded only if the fair value can be reasonably estimated at the date of donation. In 20XX, donated materials and services in the amount of $X have been recorded as revenue."
%}

{% include accordion_example.html
title="Example 2 - gift of artwork"
example_text="Contributions to the gallery’s collection in the year included XX works of art. The contributed works were appraised independently, with a fair market value of $XX. These items are reported as donation revenue, and programming and acquisition costs expensed, at their fair market value and are recognized when the deed of donation is signed and the appraisal completed."
%}

**Notes disclosing contributions received in the form of volunteer labour:**

{% include accordion_example.html
title="Example 3 - volunteer labour not accounted in financial statements"
example_text="Volunteers devote approximately 500 hours (750 in 20X0) per year to help ABC organization provide its services. Due to the difficulty in determining the fair value of contributions received in the form of services, these contributions are not recognized in their financial statements."
%}

{% include accordion_example.html
title="Example 4 - volunteer labour in financial statements"
example_text="Volunteer labour as part of its operations, our organization relies on the services of many volunteers. These services are recognized in the organization’s revenues. Volunteer hours are compiled and recorded at an hourly rate equal to the average market rate for similar services.

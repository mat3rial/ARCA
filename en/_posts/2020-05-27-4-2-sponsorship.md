Non-profit organizations often receive <a class="tip" href="{{site.baseurl}}/en/toolkit/glossary#sponsorship" target="_blank" title="A sponsorship is an exchange of goods between a sponsor and another party through which the sponsor commits to donating money, goods or services in exchange for access to the commercial potential of an activity. Sponsorship fees are not donations and the organization cannot deliver a charitable receipt for sponsorships because the sponsor typically receives the benefit of visibility in exchange. Sponsorships can be given in the form of cash, goods or services.">sponsorships</a> from businesses to fund their activities. In return, the non-profit organization may provide promotional services to the sponsor or may allow the sponsor the right to use its logo, trade name, or any similar intellectual property.

In such cases, the CRA does not consider the amount received by the non-profit organization as a payment for goods or services. Sponsorship is therefore deemed not to be a payment for a supply. The GST and the PST therefore do not apply to this transaction.

**If, however, the payment by the sponsor is made primarily (more than 50%) for advertising on television or radio, or in a newspaper, magazine, or other publication issued periodically, the payment received is not payment for a sponsorship but rather for advertising services. Therefore, the payment is subject to the GST/HST.**

example_text="A radio station, which is a non-profit organization, received $1,000 from a sponsoring company. In recognition of the funds received, the organization will broadcast a 30-second advertisement for the company in question. This ad will run three times a day for the next four weeks. Such an advertising service is normally sold for $600. The cost of advertising represents 60% of the amount paid by the sponsor. Since the amount paid is for more than 50% of a radio advertising service, the GST and the QST apply to the entire $1,000 received under the sponsorship"

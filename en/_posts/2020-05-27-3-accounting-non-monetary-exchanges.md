In this section, we will focus on exchanges of goods and services. Once again, the main issue in recognizing these transactions lies in their proper valuation.

Generally speaking, these transactions are assessed at the fair value either of the goods or services received or the goods or services suppliedâ€”**whichever is more accurate**.

Exchanges can also be treated as separate contributions.

To account for these non-monetary exchanges, it is important to ensure that the assessment of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/en/toolkit/glossary#fair-value" target="_blank" title="A payment amount agreed upon by willing parties in the normal course of business, on a level playing field such as retail sales prices of local or online commerce.">fair value</a> is sufficiently reliable. If the fair value is not sufficiently reliable, do not record it.

no = "Do not record transaction in financial statements."

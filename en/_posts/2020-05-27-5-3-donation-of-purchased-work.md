If a donor donates an artwork within three years of purchasing it, the charitable organization must issue a receipt for an amount that corresponds to the lesser market value amount of the donation and its cost to the donor immediately before the donation was made.

example_text="A donor buys a work of art valued at $300 and, six months later, donates it to a registered charity. Before donating the artwork, the donor has it appraised at a value of $1,000. In this case, the amount indicated on the receipt should be $300."

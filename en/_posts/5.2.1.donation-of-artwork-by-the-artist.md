If an artist donates an artwork, the charitable organization can issue a receipt in the amount deemed as fair market value (FMV) for that artwork.  When the FMV is less than $1,000, the assessment can be made by a member of the charity or someone with sufficient knowledge of the goods in question (i.e. the curator or artistic director in an artist-run centre). 

The value of the donation will be the fair market value of the artwork, less the artistâ€™s share of the sale at auction, as per the agreement between the artist and the organization.

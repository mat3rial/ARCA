The following information should be provided by the auditor and disclosed as notes in the financial statements:
<ul class="textlist">
  <li>a) The type of each non-monetary transaction;</li>

  <li>b) The basis for valuation (fair value) of each such transaction;</li>

  <li>c) Related gains and losses, if any.</li>
</ul>
In the notes regarding its principle accounting policies, an organization must disclose its revenue recognition method. When different methods are applied to different types of transactions generating revenues, including non-monetary exchanges (barter), the organization must indicate which method was used for each major type of product or service.

**Examples of financial statement notes:**

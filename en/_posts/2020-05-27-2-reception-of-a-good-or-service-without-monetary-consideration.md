_(CPA Canada Handbook, Chap. 4410.16)_

It is up to individual organizations to choose whether or not they will account for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/en/toolkit/glossary#contributions" target="_blank" title="Transfers, with no cash counterpart or other assets, to a non-profit organization, or settlements or cancellations with no consideration of liability to that organization such as a cash donation.">contributions</a> received in the form of goods and services in their financial statements. However, in accordance with the accounting standards applicable to non-profit organizations, if an organization does account for such contributions in its financial statements, it must ensure that the following three conditions are met:

1\. The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/en/toolkit/glossary#fair-value" target="_blank" title="A payment amount agreed upon by willing parties in the normal course of business, on a level playing field such as retail sales prices of local or online commerce.">fair value</a> of these contributions can be reasonably estimated;

2\. The goods and services received are used for operational purposes;

3\. The goods and services received are of a kind that the organization would have otherwise purchased.
